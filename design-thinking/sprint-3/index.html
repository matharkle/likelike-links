                This sprint we started focusing more directly on specific items to add too the Relaxation Corner as part of our plan to improve it. We started looking for furniture and decorations to estimate the expected cost, and we continued working with Dani from Interior Design to draw up diagrams of the realized space with our planned additions. One note the Commons Director had made was that while we want to improve privacy, we also need to consider security by allowing the staff to still effectively keep an eye on the space. With this in mind, we slightly altered our plans for adding dividers to the space to maximize the feeling of privacy while still keeping the space relatively open.

                I began working on an idea to redesigning some of the signs in the area that give information on the Nap Pod and instructions for use. Starting with the small poster next to the pod just for a sample, I tried to reimagine the theme away from just VCU/Black&Gold to something for specific to the space. To emphasize relaxation I chose a green color palette due to its association with calmness and nature, and I starting looking and different fonts that are more simple and easy to look at. I worked to reorganize the information into a more clear and easily readable format and starting deciding the overall direction to take the visual language of the posters.

                We ended this sprint with another meeting with the Commons Director to show off our initial prototypes and get feedback on our progress so far. She liked our general direction for the space and how we were continuing her theme of ‘zen garden’, and she specifically wanted to pursue our ideas to add fake plants and divider screens to the area. She also liked my proposal to reimagine the signage, and she gave approval for me to redesign all of the posters in the space. We discussed more details about the signage like which specific elements have to appear on the signs as I continue to the others and what otherwise I’m allowed to change.

                Going into the next sprint we plan to start collecting data from students using the Relaxation Corner as it is now to get an initial measurement of how people enjoy the space. We also are going to solicit feedback on our ideas for adding to the space to find out what specifically students would like to see or what they want changed. I will continue to work on redesigning the signage by establishing the aesthetic/branding and recreating the other posters in the space. Overall we will finalize the plan for our improvements to the space, start making a scale model of the space with our changes, and prepare to present our proposal at a meeting with the Commons staff at the beginning of November.
