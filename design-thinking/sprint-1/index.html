                We began by collecting information from students and other VCU community members about their feelings towards the Relaxation Corner and other elements of community spaces across campus. This consisted of face-to-face interviews, direct messaging, and Google Forms surveys.
            </p>
            <p>
                I interviewed several VCU seniors via Google Forms about their general feelings towards the art and design of community spaces across the VCU campus. This included asking for specific things they did and didn't like, and asking about their feelings towards the AI generated banner in the Relaxation Corner and the 'Uncommon' branded banners.

                Additionally, I was tasked with collecting additional examples of 'good' and 'bad' design from across campus. I collected images of numerous murals across campus and other art/design created by VCU community members that served as good examples. For the 'bad', however, I didn't much more in the way of design other than the Relaxation Corner and the 'Uncommon' branded banners that we had already identified.

                Over the course of the two weeks we didn't really find other areas of 'bad' design to address, so decided to focus our efforts on just the Relaxation Corner itself. Based on our research, we found that most students were not fond of the environement there, especially the AI generated banner, and felt that it could be improved. We also learned that the main reason for the creation of the space was for the Nap Pod there, and that it is one of many purchased for the campus.
            </p>
            <p>
                This coming week our goals are to continue interviewing students about their feelings towards the Relaxation Corner and to look into the Nap Pods more, including locating the other ones outside of the Commons to evaluate their environment. We will also reach out to the director of the Commons to learn more about the Nap Pod installation, and if they would allow us to attempt to improve the Relaxation Corner.
