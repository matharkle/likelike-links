                This sprint focused on finishing up research and consolidating ideas before our big meeting with the staff of the Commons where we will pitch our plan to redesign the Relaxation Corner. The research involved two new surveys placed in the corner to get more focused feedback from students. The first was a comment/rating box to collect students’ current thoughts on the space as a baseline measurement to compare back to at the end of the semester. The second was a poster for students to vote on what they would like to see added to the space out of the multiple options we were considering. In addition to compiling this research and preparing our options for additions to the space, we also worked on finalizing the new theme/branding concept for the signage and creating mock-ups/models of the reimagined space as we invision it.

                My main task was to continue developing the new theming/branding for the space and to finalize new designs for signage to present at the upcoming meeting. I worked with Nathan to refine my previous green color scheme and brainstorm a general brand concept involving hand-drawn bamboo to evolve the ‘zen garden’ idea currently in the space. Shortly into the process though, we decided he should split off to develop his own take instead using the dogwood flower. We each took all the information from the numerous posters in the Relaxation Corner and started rearranging it into more eye catching and easily understandable designs, while still adhering to a list of required elements given to us by the Director of the Commons.

                Our feedback from student surveys showed that students were most interested in changes that make the space feel more private, cozy, and representative of the community. The majority of respondents chose the proposed addition of privacy divider screens, plants, and art designed by students which we took into consideration in creating the mock-ups. This also helped us feel more confident in the signage decisions as the hand-drawn plants ticked two of the boxes. By and large, however, the biggest feedback we were getting was that students really did not like the AI generated poster at the back of the space.

                For the next sprint we will be preparing our actual slide presentation, establishing roles, and rehearsing for the big meeting with the staff of the Commons. Most of the rest of the sprint will depend on what feedback we get from that and which of our ideas are approved, but we should then be able to start making moves to actually implement our redesign on the space and hopefully obtain funding/assistance to do so.
