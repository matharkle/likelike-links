        <h3>reflecting on readings by Ursula K Le Guin and Laurel Schwulst</h3>
        <p>I really liked Schwulst's analogy of a website as a cabin next to a flowing river, because I think that largely encapsulates the way I think about the internet. Each webpage is just a temporary home for some of the vast amount of information constantly flowing through the web. It's always shifting and ever changing; sometimes the house changes based on what washes up from the river. Some things just flow past so quickly you don't even get to see them. Sometimes the house get abandoned, and even though things are still going by on the river, nothing changes with the house and it remains as an artifact of the past.</p>
        <p>Le Guin's "rant about 'technology'" vocalizes something I think most of us know but never really think about. The modern notion of technology is 'high-tech', flashy, and computerized; however, technology has existed since long before the computer, and that kind of tech still exists today. Because of the current way of thinking, we don't usually think about the other kinds of technology we use in our everyday lives, and often take it for granted. This reading helped remind me to notice those things and appreciate them and where they came from.</p>
